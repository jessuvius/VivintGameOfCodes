Book Return

You’ve just landed a job re-shelving books in the Bastion’s library!

As an initiate to the Lineup of Masters, you’ve been assigned to return books in the library. Due to a severely outdated system, the floor on which each book is to be re-shelved comes as a sequence of commands. A + represents ascending a floor, while a - represents descending a floor.

Your master requires all initiates to keep track of the position of any command in a sequence that would cause them to enter the library’s restricted section—floor -1 or lower.

The library is very large and you will never find the top or bottom floors.

The returns room, where books are received and prepared for re-shelving, and from which all sequences of commands are assumed to start, is located in the basement (floor 0).

To ensure books are re-shelved accurately and in a timely fashion, determine a way to know the (1-indexed) position of each command that will cause you to enter the restricted section.
